<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>For Take-home Exercise 2, my group members (<a href="https://norhendra-isss608.netlify.app/">Hendra</a> and <a href="https://isss608-blessmebellburve.netlify.app/">Jin Yao</a>) and I have decided to do <a href="https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC1.html">Mini-Challenge 1</a>.</p>
<p>Through our discussion (and the help of a wheel randomizer), we split the challenge’s questions amongst ourselves. Hendra will be doing question 2, Jin Yao will be doing question 1 and I will be doing question 3.</p>
<section id="scenario-question-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scenario-question-3">Scenario + Question 3</h2>
<p>My task in MC1 is to help Silas, a local journalist to create beautiful and informative visualizations of this data and uncover new and interesting information. Below is the question I am tasked to solve.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong>3.Use your visualizations to develop a profile of what it means to be a rising star in the music industry.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">a. <em>Visualize the careers of three artists. Compare and contrast their rise in popularity and influence.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">b. <em>Using this characterization, give three predictions of who the next Oceanus Folk stars with be over the next five years.</em></span></p>

<h1>Question 3 Part (a)</h1>
<p><span style="color:red;">Part (a): Visualize the careers of three artists. Compare and contrast their rise in popularity and influence</span></p>
<p>I have picked the following three artists and genres based on the data exploring conducted:</p>
<p><em>1. Kimberly Snyder - Dream Pop</em></p>
<p><em>2. Leyla Graf-Gotthard - Doom Metal</em></p>
<p><em>3. Szymon Pyć - Southern Gothic Rock</em></p>

<li><p>Notable: “this song was popular/critically acclaimed,” regardless of whether we know its exact chart date.</p></li>
<li><p>Notoriety_date: only exists for the subset of notable tracks that actually landed on the charts. It will just be a marker for precised chart‐entry timing information (not the whole thing) as it will always under-count the popularity signal.</p></li>

<li><p>It’s worth to note that Sailor Shift has alot more notable songs overall. But only 1 of it falls under the 2025 - 2035 period.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason why Sailor Shift isn’t considered an <strong>“rising star”</strong> is due to the combination of 2 filters.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Emerging-artist filter (2025 - 2035) - <strong>1st</strong> Oceanus Folk song_year must fall in this window.</li>
<li>“Notable” + Year - The song must have a non-NA notoriety_date in the period.</li>
