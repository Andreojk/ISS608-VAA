About this site

Hi there!
I am Andre Ong, this site is created by me as a part-time Masters of IT in Business (Data Science and Analytics) student at SMU. 

I will be showcasing some hands-on exercises on this website to practice the visualisation codes and models.


## Experience
Career wise, I have worked across project & engineering roles in the private sector for both start-ups and MNCs.

I enjoy working with data and solve business problems with it. Do feel free to connect with me as I would love to hear about your experiences!
